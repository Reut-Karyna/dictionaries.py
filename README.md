# dictionaries.py
This code demonstrates a simple implementation of a tarot card reading using a dictionary in Python. The tarot card meanings are stored in a dictionary called tarot, where each card is represented by a number and its corresponding name as the value.

A spread is created using another dictionary called spread, which represents the past, present, and future aspects of the reading. The tarot cards are randomly selected from the tarot dictionary and assigned to the respective keys in the spread dictionary using the pop() method. The pop() method not only retrieves the value corresponding to the given key but also removes the key-value pair from the dictionary.

The loop iterates over the key-value pairs in the spread dictionary and prints a statement for each key-value pair. The statement includes the key, which represents the aspect of the reading (past, present, or future), and the value, which represents the corresponding tarot card. The format of the statement is "Your [aspect] is the [tarot card] card."

This code can be used as a starting point for developing a more sophisticated tarot card reading program. Users can extend the spread dictionary or modify the code to incorporate additional tarot cards or different spreads based on their requirements.
